```bash
pip install selenium schedule
```

   - `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`: [Google app password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) for authentication
   - `EMAIL1`: Primary email recipient for notifications

## üß™ Testing

The `tests` folder in the parent directory of this repository contains individual Python files for testing various components:

python3 olympics_pin.py
```

Keep checking intervals reasonable to avoid overloading the website.

## üñ•Ô∏è Deployment

While this script can be run locally, it was designed to run on a remote instance. The recommended setup uses an `e2-micro` Compute Engine instance on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which is free. There is no need for a GUI, as script does not manipulate the website directly - instead, it just fetches the page source and analyzes it.
