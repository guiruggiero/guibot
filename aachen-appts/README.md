# ü§ñ Aachen appointment checkers

Automated scripts to check for available appointments at the Aachen, Germany Foreigners Office (Ausl√§nderamt) and Driver's License Office (F√ºhrerscheinstelle). The scripts will notify you via email (and sometimes via phone call) when appointments become available.

> **Note**: Code works as of October 2024. Updates may be needed if the Aachen websites change their structure, element IDs, or names.

Built by [Gui Ruggiero](https://guiruggiero.com/).

- [schedule](https://schedule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) - task scheduling
- [twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/quickstart/python) - phone calls

## üöÄ Setup

1. Create a `secrets` folder in the parent directory
2. Create `aachen_appts.py` in the secrets folder with the following variables:
   - `GMAIL_SENDER`: Email address for sending notifications
   - `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`: [Google app password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) for authentication
   - `EMAIL_GUI`: Primary email recipient for notifications
   - `EMAIL_GEORGIA`: Secondary email recipient
   - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`: Twilio account SID (for phone calls)
   - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`: Twilio auth token
   - `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`: Twilio phone number
   - `PHONE_GUI`: Phone number for notifications
3. Create a `screenshots` folder in the scripts directory

## üß™ Testing

The `tests` folder contains individual Python files for testing various components:
- Selenium web automation
- Email sending
- Email attachments
- Twilio phone calls

## üìù Usage

### Ausl√§nderamt script
```bash
python auslaenderamt_err_server.py
```
- Checks random team (1, 2, or 3) for appointments
- Default interval: 20 seconds
- Sends email and calls when appointments found

### F√ºhrerscheinstelle script
```bash
python fuhrerscheinstelle_err.py
```
- Checks for foreign license conversion appointments
- Default interval: 30 seconds
- Email notifications only

### Combined script
```bash
python combined_run.py
```
- Runs both scripts sequentially
- Default interval: 3 minutes

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

Adjust checking intervals by modifying:
```python
schedule.every(20).seconds.do(check_for_appt)  # Ausl√§nderamt
schedule.every(30).seconds.do(check_for_appt)  # F√ºhrerscheinstelle
schedule.every(3).minutes.do(check_for_appts)  # Combined script
```
Keep checking intervals reasonable to avoid overloading servers.

## üñ•Ô∏è Deployment

While these scripts can be run locally, they were designed to run on a remote instance. The recommended setup uses an `e2-small` Compute Engine instance on Google Cloud Platform with Chrome Remote Desktop for Linux. Follow the setup guide [here](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/chrome-desktop-remote-on-compute-engine).
